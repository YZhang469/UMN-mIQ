This repository contains R code for the simulations conducted in the manuscript.

The functions for interactive Q-learning are modified based on Linn et al. (2015). The `iqLearn` functions need to be modified because, in the simulation, we use a test dataset with all counterfactual outcomes to assess the performance of each model.
